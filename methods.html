        <h3>1) Are the granitoid outcrops in this area part of a massive cogenetic suite, or are they part of different and unrelated magmatic events?</h3>
        <h3>2) What is the age, or range of ages, of the intrusive suite?</h3>
        <h3>3) How did the intrusive suite differentiate?</h3>
        <h3>4) What is the tectonic and magmatic origin of the intrusive suite?</h3>

            <p>U/Pb geochronology utilizes the decay of radioactive U and Th isotopes in rocks 
                to determine ages of crystallization. 238U, 235U, and 232Th are radioactive parent isotopes 
                that decay to stable Pb isotopes and follow unique decay series. 238U decays to 206Pb with 
                a half-life of 4.468 Ga, 235U decays to 207Pb with a half-life of 703.8 Ma, and 232Th 
                decays to 208Pb with a half-life of 14.01 Ga. 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb are all stable and 
                radiogenic isotopes, and therefore only exist in significant amounts as results of these 
                radioactive decays, unlike 204Pb which is entirely primordial and does not form by 
                radioactive decay. The isotopic ratios 238U/206Pb and 235U/207Pb are used to determine the 
                age of the zircon grain in a sample. When these isotopic ratios agree on an age, they will 
                plot on the concordia line. When the 238U/206Pb and 235U/207Pb isotopic ratios plot on the 
                concordia line, and therefore yield the same age, the zircon grains are presumed to have 
                remained a closed system since crystallization and the sample is said to be concordant.</p>
            <p>The U/Pb dating method is applied to zircon crystals because the crystal lattice of 
                zircon incorporates both uranium and thorium, but strongly rejects lead. The chemical 
                formula of zircon is ZrSiO4. Zirconium, uranium, and thorium all commonly take 
                oxidation states of +4, allowing for substitution of uranium and thorium for zirconium in 
                the crystal lattice. The most common oxidation state of lead is +2, making it a larger ion 
                that will not fit in the crystal lattice in place of zirconium. When zircons yield concordant 
                ages, it can often be assumed that they contained no initial lead, and all measured lead is 
                a radiogenic and a result of the decay of uranium and thorium. Although zircon is in 
                relatively low abundance in a granitoid rock when compared to other minerals, zirconâ€™s 
                low magnetic susceptibility and high density makes separation and preparation of a pure 
                zircon sample viable.</p>

        <p>Analysis of the chemical composition of samples is necessary for answering the 
            research questions presented in this study. Determining the elemental and mineralogical 
            composition of rocks aids in establishing if the rock units in question are a cogenetic 
            intrusive suite, and if so, how they differentiated. Whole-rock analysis of samples yields 
            the concentrations of major and trace elements present in a sample. Major elements are 
            presented as weight percentages in their oxide forms. Trace elements are presented in 
            ppm in their elemental form. Because of their high concentrations, major element 
            compositions are responsible for the physical properties of melts and the minerals that 
            precipitate from them. Along with field observations, differentiation of cogenetic igneous 
            rocks is best characterized by looking for trends in various plots that compare different 
            combinations of major elemental oxides. Trace elements, on the other hand, give insight 
            into the origin of a melt due to their relatively consistent proportions in a magmatic body
            throughout the entirety of its evolution. Trace elements are generally less strongly
            affected by the crystallization of individual phases, and often only occur as impurities in 
            other minerals.</p>
