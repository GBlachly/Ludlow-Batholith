            <p>The Mojave Desert is home to rocks that represent every phase of western United 
                States Cordilleran evolution, yet it is significantly less researched than other regions on 
                the west coast, partially because of widespread Cenozoic cover. Plutons in the 
                Mojave Desert are particularly important features of Cordilleran geology because they 
                are located where Laramide disruption first affected the western U.S., and where it also 
                did the most damage to the underlying lithosphere. As a result of this, many plutons in the Mojave, 
                especially those that formed synchronously with Laramide disruption, have very important stories to tell 
                about an enigmatic time and place in the geologic past.

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The Mojave Desert is an important section of California for geological research, 
                as it was the first region of the western United States to experience the effects of 
                Laramide disruption. This study looks at plutonic rocks in the vicinity of Ludlow, CA in 
                the Mojave Desert, and focuses on one section of the Bristol Mountains where a large 
                area of plutonic rock is exposed. Geologic mapping in the Bristol Mountains, 
                reconnaissance sampling, U-Pb geochronology, and whole-rock compositional analysis 
                were used to gather information into the magmatic and tectonic origins of the Bristol 
                Mountains field site, and the associated plutonic rocks in the surrounding area. The 
                Bristol Mountains site predominantly consists of five felsic units that range from 
                granodiorite to granite. Also found at the site are large blobs of gabbro to the east, and 
                mylonites that are products of a metamorphic core complex to the west. Three new U-Pb 
                radiometric ages yield an age of 77.2 ± 1.3 Ma at the rim of the pluton, and ages of 74.9 ± 
                1.2 Ma and 74.6 ± 1.3 Ma in units closer to the core. From the concentric zoning and 
                compositional variations of the five felsic Bristol Mountains units, it was determined that 
                they are part of a large cogenetic intrusive suite referred to here as the Ludlow batholith, 
                and that these units probably young inwards from the southeast to the northwest. 
                Exposures of the Ludlow batholith were also found about 50 km to the southwest in the 
                Rodman Mountains, and it is likely that about 2,000 km2 of the central Mojave is 
                underlain by a contiguous Ludlow batholith. From analysis of REEs and other trace 
                elements, it was also revealed that Ludlow batholith is not a result of normal arc 
                magmatism, and instead likely formed from slab-tear magmatism at the boundary of the 
                Shatsky conjugate and Farallon Plate.

                        <h4>Proterozoic</h4>
                        <p>The Proterozoic Mojave Desert region experienced several complex plutonic
                            events between 1.76 and 1.64 Ga (Strickland et al., 2013; Wooden and Miller, 1990). Magmatism 
                            initiated around 1.76 Ga when a pre-orogenic magmatic suite began to 
                            intrude supracrustal metasedimentary gneisses that were originally deposited about 1.79-
                            1.75 Ga. Between 1.71 and 1.69 Ga, the Mojave Desert was part of a 
                            significant, regionally extensive deformation event known as the Ivanpah Orogeny 
                            (Wooden and Miller, 1990).
                            </p>
                        <p>Between 1.5 and 1.4 Ga, North America entered a period of localized extension and 
                            continent-wide intrusion of crustal-derived anorogenic granitoids that were emplaced into 
                            the upper crust (Anderson and Bender, 1989). Magmatism responsible for the origin of these
                             anorogenic granites is related to heating of an undepleted mantle, and the rise of mantle plumes 
                             into the undifferentiated Proterozoic crust (Anderson and Bender, 1989).</p>
                        <h4>Paleozoic</h4>
                        <p>Scattered Paleozoic strata unconformably overlay the Proterozoic basement but 
                            are only exposed locally throughout the Mojave Desert as metasedimentary wall rocks 
                            (Stone et al., 1983). Most of these exposed strata are deformed and metamorphosed, 
                            especially when in contact with Mesozoic plutons (Stone et al., 1983).
                            </p>
                        <h4>Triassic</h4>
                        <p>The onset of Triassic magmatism reflects a shift from a passive to convergent 
                            margin in Western North America (Burchfiel and Davis, 1975; DeCelles, 2004; Miller, 
                            1978; Yonkee and Weil, 2015). Triassic Mojave plutons mark the beginning of arc 
                            magmatism related to the east-directed subduction of the Farallon plate, beneath the 
                            North American plate, which initiated in the latest Permian and continued into the 
                            Cretaceous (Miller, 1978). Although they signify an important shift 
                            in the tectonics of the region, Triassic plutons throughout the Mojave Desert are scarce 
                            when compared to younger Mesozoic plutons.

                        <h4>Jurassic</h4>
                        <p>Formed by the continued oblique subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the 
                            North American plate that initiated during the Permian, the Jurassic magmatic arc was 
                            once continuous from Sierra Nevada, through the Mojave, and into the Peninsular ranges 
                            (Miller and Glazner; 1995, Schermer and Busby, 1994). This second pulse of arc 
                            magmatism commenced in the central and eastern Mojave during the Early Jurassic, with 
                            the emplacement of plutons at 183 Ma and 181 Ma (Barth et al., 2016). Once initiated, 
                            Jurassic magmatism in the southwestern U.S. Cordillera was voluminous and melt 
                            production increased until it reached a peak ca. 161 Ma, at which point melt production 
                            decreased over time and the arc began migrating westward (Barth et al., 2016) In the Mojave region, 
                            Jurassic magmatism may have terminated as late as 146 Ma 
                            (Tosdal and Wooden, 2015) and was then followed by a period of approximately 26 m.y. 
                            where no granitic intrusions were emplaced east of the Sierra Nevada or in the Mojave 
                            (Chen and Moore, 1982).
                            </p>
                        <h4>Cretaceous</h4>
                        <p>At about 120 Ma, emplacement of mid Cretaceous granitic plutons began and was 
                            followed by steady eastward migration of arc magmatism (Chen and Moore, 1982). This 
                            eastward migration of magmatism is related to the flattening of the subduction zone, 
                            which results in an eastward migration of the position of the mantle wedge responsible 
                            for producing melts associated with arc magmatism (Chen and Moore, 1982). At 90 Ma, an 
                            oceanic plateau, known as the Shatsky conjugate, within the 
                            Farallon plate began to subduct beneath the North American plate and resulted in this 
                            period of increased flat slab subduction and further eastward migration of magmatism 
                            (Liu et al., 2010; Saleeby, 2003). Mid-to-late 
                            Cretaceous (100-81 Ma) plutonic rocks represent the late stage of normal arc magmatism, 
                            which ultimately ceases in most of the Mojave Desert at 80 Ma (Needy et al., 2009). Late 
                            Cretaceous magmatism however continued 
                            between 80 Ma and 72 Ma in certain areas (which includes the area described in this study) of 
                            the Mojave when normal arc magmatism 
                            had already ceased throughout most of the Cordillera (Needy et al., 2009)
                            </p>
                        <h4>Laramide Compression and Post-Laramide Extension</h4>
                        <p>Low angle subduction of the Farallon plate beneath the North American plate not 
                            only contributed to the cessation of magmatism during the Late Cretaceous, but also 
                            produced compressional and extensional events in the western United States. The 
                            compressional events caused by the initial low-angle subduction of the Farallon plate and 
                            oceanic plateau are known as the Laramide orogeny, which began at approximately 80 
                            Ma and continued until approximately 35 Ma as deformation migrated NE towards the 
                            continental interior (Liu et al., 2010; Livaccari, 1991; Saleeby, 2003)

                <p>Many large intrusive suites were emplaced near the end of Late Cretaceous arc

                    aid in identifying whether a newly studied plutonic body can be considered part of a 
                    cogenetic intrusive suite. Several intrusive suites of the Sierra Nevada batholith, such as 
                    the Tuolumne, Whitney, and Sahwave intrusive suites, have been studied in detail and 
                    therefore are good examples of Cretaceous intrusive complexes in the Cordilleran region
