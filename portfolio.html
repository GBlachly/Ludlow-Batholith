            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Mojave Desert is home to rocks that represent every phase of western United 
                States Cordilleran evolution, yet it is significantly less researched than other regions on 
                the west coast, partially because of widespread Cenozoic cover. Plutons in the 
                Mojave Desert are particularly important features of Cordilleran geology because they 
                are located where Laramide disruption first affected the western U.S., and where it also 
                did the most damage to the underlying lithosphere </p>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The Mojave Desert is an important section of California for geological research, 
                as it was the first region of the western United States to experience the effects of 
                Laramide disruption. This study looks at plutonic rocks in the vicinity of Ludlow, CA in 
                the Mojave Desert, and focuses on one section of the Bristol Mountains where a large 
                area of plutonic rock is exposed. Geologic mapping in the Bristol Mountains, 
                reconnaissance sampling, U-Pb geochronology, and whole-rock compositional analysis 
                were used to gather information into the magmatic and tectonic origins of the Bristol 
                Mountains field site, and the associated plutonic rocks in the surrounding area. The 
                Bristol Mountains site predominantly consists of five felsic units that range from 
                granodiorite to granite. Also found at the site are large blobs of gabbro to the east, and 
                mylonites that are products of a metamorphic core complex to the west. Three new U-Pb 
                radiometric ages yield an age of 77.2 ± 1.3 Ma at the rim of the pluton, and ages of 74.9 ± 
                1.2 Ma and 74.6 ± 1.3 Ma in units closer to the core. From the concentric zoning and 
                compositional variations of the five felsic Bristol Mountains units, it was determined that 
                they are part of a large cogenetic intrusive suite referred to here as the Ludlow batholith, 
                and that these units probably young inwards from the southeast to the northwest. 
                Exposures of the Ludlow batholith were also found about 50 km to the southwest in the 
                Rodman Mountains, and it is likely that about 2,000 km2 of the central Mojave is 
                underlain by a contiguous Ludlow batholith. From analysis of REEs and other trace 
                elements, it was also revealed that Ludlow batholith is not a result of normal arc 
                magmatism, and instead likely formed from slab-tear magmatism at the boundary of the 
                Shatsky conjugate and Farallon Plate.
