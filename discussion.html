        <h2>Intrusions in the Bristol Mountains </h2>
        <p>From the southeast to the northwest, the five mapped felsic units of the Bristol 
            Mountains field site are referred to as Kbw, Ker, Kbt, Krd, and Kpb. The 
            order and method of differentiation of these units is not clear cut.
            </p>
        <h3>Evidence of cogenetic intrusive suite</h3>
        <p>-The five felsic units in the study area form a concentrically zoned pluton, where units are 
            generally concave in shape, follow near parallel strike directions, and mostly have gradational 
            contacts.</p>
        <p>-The Bristol Mountain intrusions are also compositionally similar but exhibit the 
            slight changes in texture and mineralogy that are seen in most Cordilleran Cretaceous 
            intrusive suites. All five units are predominately granodiorite or granite 
            with a consistently medium- to coarse-grained groundmass. Rocks with 
            finer-grained, more equigranular textures are located on the outer southeastern edge of 
            the pluton, while rocks with coarser-grained, porphyritic textures are located to the 
            northwestern sections of the pluton.
            </p>
        <p>-Geochemical data from the Bristol Mountains rocks also indicate that the five 
            felsic units are related and part of one cohesive intrusive suite. Harker plots comparing 
            the units of the Bristol Mountains field site all exhibit generally linear trends, with three 
            of the four producing very strong linear trends.

        <h2>Defining the Ludlow Batholith </h2>
        <p>The Bristol Mountains field site and the segment of the Rodman Mountains 
            determined to be part of the Ludlow batholith, possibly represent two opposite sides of 
            this large intrusive suite. Most of the intervening area is covered by Cenozoic 
            volcanic and sedimentary strata, which makes more detailed observations about most of 
            the proposed Ludlow batholith nearly impossible. From field observations and 
            geochronological data, it can be determined that the Bristol Mountain units represent the 
            very northeast edge of the Ludlow batholith. The two samples from the Rodman Mountains overlap 
            with the Bristol Mountain samples on all geochemical plots, and therefore are likely to represent 
            the same units as those found in the Bristol Mountains.

        <h2>The Case for Slab-Tear Magmatism in the Central Mojave </h2>
        <p>Normal arc magmatism involving mantle-wedge-derived melt ceased throughout the 
            Sierra Nevada and Peninsular ranges around 80 Ma, when magmatism migrated eastward 
            due to the decreasing angle of subduction of the Farallon plate (Chen and Moore, 1982; 
            Kistler and Peterman, 1973; Irwin and Wooden 2001). The subduction of the 
            large igneous province, known as the Shatsky conjugate, that was embedded within the 
            Farallon plate, is generally thought to have been the catalyst for the drastic change in 
            subduction angle and the eastward migration of arc magmatism that occurred after 
            magmatic arc cessation in the Sierras (Saleeby, 2003; Liu et al., 2010)
            </p>
        <p>It is unlikely that the Ludlow batholith was a product of normal arc 
            magmatism because of the low-angle orientation of the Farallon plate at the time, and 
            therefore may have a complex tectonic origin that has not yet been thoroughly explored 
            in published literature. 
            Whole-rock trace-element data suggests that rock samples from both the Bristol 
            and Rodman Mountains have trace-element concentrations analogous to samples of 
            several known examples of slab-tear magmatism. Geochemical 
            discrimination plots developed by Hildebrand and Whalen (2017), compare various 
            combinations of rare-earth elements (REEs), as well as other trace elements, to create a 
            method of separating arc-derived magmas from slab-tear derived magmas
            </p>
        <p>On all five trace-element plots, all samples from the Bristol Mountains cluster and plot well 
            within the range of values associated with slab-tear plutonism.</p>

        <h2>Slab-Tear Model for the Origin of the Ludlow Batholith </h2>
        <p>The preferred model for evolution of the Mesozoic magmatism within the Mojave 
            Desert involves several stages that ultimately conclude with slab-tear magmatism
            </p>
        <p>Stage 1 (100-92 Ma) includes normal arc magmatism in the Central Mojave. This form of 
            magmatism is comparable to that found throughout the southern Sierra 
            Nevada and the Peninsular Ranges. 
            </p>
        <p>Stage 2 (91-82 Ma) marks the transition from normal angle subduction of the Farallon plate, 
            to increasingly low-angle subduction due to the 
            incipient subduction of the buoyant oceanic plateau known as the Shatsky conjugate (Liu 
            et al., 2010). The end of stage 2 coincides with 
            the cessation of the magmatic arc in the Sierra Nevada and Peninsular Ranges batholith at 
            80 Ma (Chapman et al., 2016; Chen and Moore, 1982).
            </p>
        <p>Stage 3 (about 81 Ma) defines the period in the central Mojave Desert where magmatism was lacking, 
            likely because the Farallon plate had reached an angle of subduction low enough that a mantle 
            wedge no longer existed, and melting was not occurring in the upper mantle as it had 
            been during the previous stage.
            </p>
        <p>Stage 4 (80-73 Ma) results from the propagation of a 
            slab tear between the Farallon plate and the Shatsky conjugate. As the Shatsky 
            conjugate continually travelled along the bottom of the North American plate due to its 
            increased buoyancy when compared to regular oceanic lithosphere, the negative buoyant 
            forces were continually pulling the Farallon plate towards the mantle and away from the 
            Shatsky conjugate. Eventually, normal oceanic crust began to subduct again at 
            increasingly more normal angles, and once the oceanic crust sank far enough, a slab tear 
            developed at the boundary between the Farallon plate and the backside of the Shatsky 
            conjugate. This slab tear opened up significant space at the boundary of the 
            oceanic plateau that was filled by an asthenospheric upwelling of deep melt, which 
            generated the Ludlow batholith.
