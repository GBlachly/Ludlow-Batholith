        <h2>Reconnaissance Sampling</h2>
        <p>Reconnaissance samples were collected to determine whether plutonic rocks in 
            the surrounding area may be related to the five felsic units of the Bristol Mountains field 
            mapping area. One sample was collected from the Cady Mountains to the west of 
            the mapping site, one was collected from the Lava Bed Mountains to the south, and four 
            were collected from the Rodman Mountains to the southwest. 
            </p>
        <p>Each sample collected shared some resemblance to at least one of the five felsic units of the Bristol Mountains site, but samples GB 2004 and GB 2010 located in the Rodman Mountains 
            bore the closest resemblance. Samples GB 2004 and GB 2010 are representative of a large area of the Rodman Mountains, as the same rock units 
            were continually seen throughout the surrounding area on drives and hikes. Both 
            GB 2004 and GB 2010 were collected from the same ridge miles from one another, and it 
            seems likely that rocks similar to the Bristol Mountains site are found consistently 
            between the two samples.

        <h2>U/Pb Geochronology</h2>
        <p>Three samples from the Bristol Mountains site were collected for zircon U/Pb 
            geochronology to constrain crystallization ages of the felsic units. These 
            samples were GB 1907 from Kbw, GB 1910 from Ker, and GB 1905 from Kbt. All three samples yielded Late Cretaceous ages, contained older inherited cores, and 
            exhibited oscillatory zoning textures. 
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>GB 1907 (Kbw) yielded ages ranging from 75.8 to 78.6 Ma, and a 
                weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 77.2 ± 1.3 Ma with a 95% confidence
                </li>
            <li>GB 1910 (Ker) yielded ages ranging from 72.0 to 76.0 
                Ma, and a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 74.9 ± 1.2 Ma with a 95% confidence
                </li>
            <li>GB 1905 (Kbt) yielded ages ranging from 69.3 to 77.3 Ma, and a 
                weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 74.6 ± 1.3 Ma with a 95% confidence

        <h2>Whole-Rock Major-Element Geochemistry</h2>
        <p>Fourteen samples collected from the Bristol Mountains mapping site, and 
            six samples from various locations in the Cady, Lava Bed, and Rodman Mountains were analyzed for whole-rock major-elemental composition
            </p>
        <p>The diagrams used to evaluate geochemical 
            trends and variation are as follows: (1) Harker plots of oxides vs. silica (Fig. 24), (2) 
            major-element oxides vs. distance across the five units at the Bristol Mountains mapping 
            site, (3) modified alkali-lime index diagram, (4) aluminum 
            saturation index vs. alkalinity index diagram, (5) iron index diagram, 
            and (6) quartz-plagioclase-alkali feldspar ternary diagram.

        <h2>Trace Element Geochemistry</h2>
        <p>Six samples collected from the Bristol Mountains mapping site, and six 
            samples from various locations in the Cady, Lava Bed, and Rodman Mountains 
            were analyzed for trace-element data. Trace-element data is plotted in several diagrams to compare samples to one another, and to other plutons of varying tectonic origins. All five trace-element plots are derived from Hildebrand and Whalen, 2017.
