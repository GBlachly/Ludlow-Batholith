        <h2>Mapping and Sampling</h2>
        <p>To address the research questions, samples at the mapping site were collected for 
            U/Pb geochronology and whole rock geochemistry. For U/Pb geochronology, one sample 
            was collected from each of the mapped plutonic units to determine an age for these units. 
            Eleven samples along a 5.5 km transect were collected for whole-rock major 
            element compositional analysis. This transect runs perpendicular to the 
            interplutonic contacts at the site and goes through all five major mapping units. The location 
            of the collected samples can be seen in the <a href="./geo-map.html">geologic map section</a>.
            </p>
        <p>Reconnaissance sampling also took place outside of the smaller mapping site, in 
            the greater area surrounding Ludlow, CA. Sampling sites were chosen from an 
            area of about 4000 square kilometers, where rock units that are visually similar and 
            possibly cogenetically related to the Bristol Mountain units are located.

        <h2>U-Pb Geochronolgy</h2>
        <p>U/Pb geochronology utilizes the decay of radioactive U and Th isotopes in rocks 
            to determine ages of crystallization. The U/Pb dating method is applied to zircon crystals 
            because the crystal lattice of zircon incorporates both uranium and thorium, but strongly rejects lead. 
            By comparing the ratios of U and Pb in zircon crystals, an age of the rock can be determined.
            </p>
        <p>Zircon U/Pb analyses were conducted at the SHRIMP-RG laboratory at Stanford 
            University. The SHRIMP-RG is a double-focusing secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS). 
            The SHRIMP-RG uses a beam of primary oxygen ions to create and sputter secondary ions from the
            zircon grains into the mass spectrometer, which detects abundance of the ionic/molecular species 
            for the Pb, U, and Th isotopes present.

        <h2>Geochemistry</h2>
        <p>Analysis of the chemical composition of samples is necessary for answering the 
            research questions presented in this study. Determining the elemental and mineralogical 
            composition of rocks aids in establishing if the rock units in question are a cogenetic 
            intrusive suite, and if so, how they differentiated. Whole-rock analysis of samples yields 
            the concentrations of major and trace elements present in a sample.
            </p>
        <p>Because of their high concentrations, major element 
            compositions are responsible for the physical properties of melts and the minerals that 
            precipitate from them. Along with field observations, differentiation of cogenetic igneous 
            rocks is best characterized by looking for trends in various plots that compare different 
            combinations of major elemental oxides. 
            </p>
        <p>Trace elements, on the other hand, give insight 
            into the origin of a melt due to their relatively consistent proportions in a magmatic body
            throughout the entirety of its evolution.
